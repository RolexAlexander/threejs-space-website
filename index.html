			<h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
			<br>
			<p>
				Step into my first 3D website, a cosmic concept designed to spark inspiration. This theme was born from a powerful quote that stuck with me: "Aim for the stars, and even if you fall short, you'll still soar among them." It's my portfolio's cornerstone, a reminder that embracing the journey toward greatness yields something truly remarkable. It's in savoring every step that we often uncover greatness and wonder beyond our expectations.

        <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Inspiration for 2024</h2>

        <p>
			In the journey of our lives, what truly matters isn't the things we collect but the person we grow to be. Stepping into 2024, let's take to heart Inky Johnson's powerful words: "It's not what you acquire; it's who you become." It's not about the stuff we gather but about the resilience we build, the kindness we share, and the character we develop. This year, let's focus not just on getting things but on becoming better versions of ourselves‚Äîstronger, kinder, and more resilient. Let's create a story where our growth and integrity shine brighter than any possession, inspiring everyone we meet along the way.
